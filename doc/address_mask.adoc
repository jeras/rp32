= Address mask

== Introduction

The aim is to generalize the idea of limiting the address space to less than XLEN address bits.
The address mask would be applied to both the instruction fetch unit (IFU) and load/store unit (LSU).

== Considerations

* review all PC related instructions,
* review all load/store (memory) instructions,
* RISCOF related considetations

== Implementation

* special timing constrains?
